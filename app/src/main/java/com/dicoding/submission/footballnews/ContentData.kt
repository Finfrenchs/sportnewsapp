            "Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard lead the way, having combined for 36 goals in the competition, while the Spurs duo are one behind David Silva and Sergio Aguero for Manchester City and Arsenal legends Robert Pires and Thierry Henry.\n" +
            "Kane and Son's total of goal combinations this season is already eight, meaning they are comfortably on track to set a Premier League record for the most by any duo in a single campaign. \n" +

                    "Go for a differential?\n" +
                    "However, Son and Salah's midfield team-mates, Mane and Bale, can tempt those in search of an overlooked pick.\n" +
                    "Mane sits in 6.2 per cent of squads and is fit for Liverpool’s Merseyside derby visit to Everton.\n" +
                    "The Senegalese winger has already thrived on the road this term, scoring twice and claiming 16 points at Chelsea in Gameweek 2.\n" +

                    "Liverpool’s short-term schedule offers further encouragement, with back-to-back home encounters with Sheffield United and West Ham United to follow.\n" +
                    "Take a risk with Bale?\n" +
                    "Bale can be found in only 0.5 per cent of squads ahead of Spurs’ home encounter with West Ham.\n" +
                    "Bringing him in carries a little more risk for Gameweek 5, with head coach Jose Mourinho saying the Welshman will “probably” feature on Sunday afternoon.\n" +
                    "“Gareth being ready to be in the squad is a decision we are going to make tomorrow (Saturday),\" Mourinho told Spurs' official website.\n" +
                    "\"There is still one day to think, to reflect on what is best for the team, what is best for him, and we will arrive at a good conclusion.”\n" +
                    "Nonetheless, his upcoming matches suggest that even if Bale is eased into action off the bench, he can still profit.\n" +

                    "Importantly, Bielsa sometimes deploys Dallas in midfield. Indeed, he used him in the centre of the pitch against Sheffield United in Gameweek 3.\n" +
                    "Dallas had two shots on target against the Blades and got clean-sheet points in his side’s 1-0 win.\n" +
